AReaL (Ant Reasoning RL) is an open-source **fully asynchronous reinforcement learning training system** for large reasoning models developed at **the RL Lab, Ant Research**. Built upon the open-source project [RealHF](https://github.com/openpsi-project/ReaLHF), we are fully committed to open-source by providing training details, data, and infrastructure required to reproduce results along with the model itself. AReaL aims to help everyone build their own AI agents easily and affordably. Our team loves milk tea because it's delicious, customizable, and affordable. We hope you enjoy our project just like how you enjoy real-world milk tea (cheers).

**[2025/06/03] (v0.3, boba¬≤)** We release **boba¬≤** (double-boba) for fully asynchronous RL training, which achieves a **2.77x speedup while obtaining on-par or even better training performance** compared to synchronous systems. Moreover, asynchronous RL makes it extremely easy to set up multi-turn agentic RL training! Check out [our v0.3 overview blog](/blog/AReaL_v0_3.md) and the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24298).

### Overview of Asynchronous RL Training

During the synchronous RL training process, a generation step must wait until the longest sequence completes within the batch of LLM outputs. Due to the varying output lengths for LRMs, a synchronous RL system suffers from massive GPU idle time, leading to training inefficiency. Some recent works ([DeepCoder](https://pretty-radio-b75.notion.site/DeepCoder-A-Fully-Open-Source-14B-Coder-at-O3-mini-Level-1cf81902c14680b3bee5eb349a512a51), [Intellect](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/intellect-2)) propose overlapping a single training step with a single generation step to accelerate training. However, the largest bottleneck remains unchanged: the samples within a batch are still from the same model version, leading to waiting and GPU idle time.

![Synchronous vs One-step Overlap RL](/assets/sync_one_step_gen.png)

*Fig.1. Left: Execution timeline of synchronous RL training. Right: Execution timeline of one-step overlap RL system.*

AReaL adopts a fully asynchronous RL training framework that completely decouples generation from training. In AReaL, LLM generation runs in a streaming manner, with each rollout worker continuously producing outputs without waiting. Meanwhile, trainer workers perform parallel model updates upon receiving training batches.

*Fig 2. Execution timeline of our fully asynchronous RL system.*

AReaL follows a system-algorithm co-design principle: on the system side, AReaL efficiently syncs model parameters and carefully controls the staleness of each training sample; on the algorithm side, AReaL improves the objective of PPO to make async-RL stable.

We compare the scalability of **asynchronous RL** training based on our AReaL-boba¬≤ system with **classical synchronous RL** training (we adopt the fastest open-source system veRL, main branch on 05/07/2025) across different model sizes and different numbers of H800 GPUs. AReaL demonstrates much improved scaling capabilities with respect to training throughput. This is also partially due to AReaL decoupling training and generation, leading to much fewer GPU memory fragments.

### RL Training for Multi-turn Agent

AReaL-boba¬≤ allows you to independently customize the [dataset](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/customization/dataset.html), [rollout behavior](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/customization/agent.html), and the [training algorithm](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/customization/algorithm.html), without needing to modify the heavy system-level code.

In particular, we show a simple example to develop a multi-turn math agent for RL training. Please see the learning curve below and reference the [step-by-step guide](https://inclusionai.github.io/AReaL/customization/agent.html) if you want to implement your own agentic RL project.

```

Train Qwen3 1.7B locally (Remember to modify `dataset.path` in the script below):
